# Notes
1. Always save the annotations in the CVAT server before exporting them.
2. Make sure to to use CVAT for video 1.1 and NOT CVAT for images 1.1 when exporting the annotations from the CVAT server.
3. Always reupload the zip folder to the seg and track server after re-exporting the annotations from the CVAT server as the annotations are not updated automatically even if the zip folder has the same name.
4. When uploading the annotations back onto CVAT uncheck "Convert masks to polygons".
5. When exporting a regsementation you don't have to save the images, just the annotations.
